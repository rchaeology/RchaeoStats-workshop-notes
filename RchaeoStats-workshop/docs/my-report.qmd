## Introduction

This is a totally made-up study on a completely fictional archaeological site,
but the data are very real.  
Blah, blah, blah.

It is **very** important to state that *any* ***conclusions*** reached in this report are the
ramblings of a _fictional_ character.

## Materials

Here is a list of materials used during excavation:

- whip
  + for carefully excavating ancient materials
    * something else
- hat
  + for protection form the hot sun
    + something else
- gun
  + to keep away dig-site cats

In order of importance

1. gun
2. hat
3. whip

## Methods

I recently learned how to use R and couldn't wait to use it in this study!
I am using `r version$version.string` `r version$nickname`.

## Results

```{r}
#| label: tbl-summary-phase
#| tbl-cap: "This is a useful caption."
#| echo: false
mortuary_data |>
  mutate(Area = Length * Width) |>
  group_by(Phase) |>
  summarise(
    mean = mean(Area, na.rm = T),
    sd = sd(Area, na.rm = T)
  ) |>
  arrange(desc(mean)) |>
  knitr::kable(col.names = c("Phase", "Mean (cm^2)", "SD"))
```

Here's a figure

```{r}
#| warning: false
#| label: fig-phase-plot
mortuary_data |>
  filter(Phase != "disturbed") |>
  ggplot(aes(x = Phase, y = Length)) +
  geom_violin(aes(fill = Phase)) +
  geom_boxplot(width = 0.2) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

This argument is supported by @tbl-summary-phase and @fig-phase-plot
